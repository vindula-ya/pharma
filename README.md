## How to run and install

### Start the server

## How to use the routes
The routes.js file has a list of all the routes. All that has to be done is added the route to the end of the base URL which is "http://localhost:8080" with the prefix of "/restaturant" such as "http://localhost:8000/restaurant/user". 

The "POST /login" route will return a JSON Web Token which is needed to access the routes with the authentication middleware function. Once the token is returned by that route, the token should be passed in the request with a header called "token".
